# SSE-based MCP Server for Code Memory Management

This demonstrates a working pattern for SSE-based MCP servers that provide code memory management tools using [mem0](https://mem0.ai) and [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies using `uv`:
```bash
# Install in editable mode from pyproject.toml
uv pip install -e .

OR

uv pip install httpx "mcp[cli]" mem0ai
```

3. Update `.env` file in the root directory with your mem0 API key:
```bash
MEM0_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

1. Start the MCP server:
```bash
uv run main.py
```

2. In Cursor, connect to the SSE endpoint:
```
http://0.0.0.0:8080/sse
```

## Features

The server provides three main tools for code memory management:

1. `add_code_memory`: Store code snippets, implementation details, and coding patterns with comprehensive context including:
   - Complete code with dependencies
   - Language/framework versions
   - Setup instructions
   - Documentation and comments
   - Example usage
   - Best practices

2. `get_all_code_memory`: Retrieve all stored code memories to analyze patterns, review implementations, and ensure no relevant information is missed.

3. `search_code_memory`: Semantically search through stored memories to find relevant:
   - Code implementations
   - Programming solutions
   - Best practices
   - Setup guides
   - Technical documentation

## Why?
This implementation allows for a persistent code memory system that can be accessed via MCP. The SSE-based server can run as a process that agents connect to, use, and disconnect from whenever needed. This pattern fits well with "cloud-native" use-cases where the server and clients can be decoupled processes on different nodes.

### Server

By default, server runs on 0.0.0.0:8080, but is configurable with command line arguments like: 
```
uv run main.py --host <your host> --port <your port>
```

The server exposes an SSE endpoint at `/sse` that MCP clients can connect to for accessing the memory management tools.
